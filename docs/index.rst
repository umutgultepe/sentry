Sentry
======

Sentry is a modern error logging and aggregation platform.

It's important to note that Sentry should not be thought of as a log stream,
but as an aggregator. It fits somewhere in-between a simple metrics
solution (such as `Graphite <http://graphite.wikidot.com/>`_) and a full-on
log stream aggregator (like `Logstash <http://logstash.net/>`_).
